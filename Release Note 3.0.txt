CK.Core 3.0 - Roadmap

- Apparition:
	- Util.EmptyArray<T>
	- .Net 4.0 support use the Microsoft BCL Portability Pack 1.1.3 (but still requires net40/CK.Core.dll for IReadOnlyXXX support).
	- New Util.InterlokedXXX methods (atomic set and array manipulations).
	- CKExceptionData captures exception data. It allows serialization of exception data without requiring knowledge of the exception Type.
	- ActivityMonitor
		- "Logging is cool, Monitoring is better"
		- Clear and enforced definition of threading issues:
			- An ActivityMonitor usage is NOT thread-affine. It is Activity-affine: any thread can use an ActivityMonitor provided they do not call it at the same time.
			- An ActivityMonitor usage is NOT thread-safe and NOT reentrant: such usage are detected and explicit exceptions are thrown.
			- Registration of IActivityMonitorClients follows the same rules: registering or unregistering a Client must not be concurrent.
			- ActivityMonitor usage is most of the time lock-free (even with the GrandOutput).
		- Centralized outputs (GrandOutput)
			- Global history enables effective analysis of the activity of the whole System.
			- GrandOutput is configurable (routes and actions).
			- GrandOutput is thread-safe.
			- Cross AppDomain monitoring is supported.
		- Support of file name/line number.
		- New LogEntry model that captures contextual information (errors and fatal are "contextualized" with their "Activity Path").
		- Multiple ActivityMonitorClients (memory, binary file, text file).
		- Newed ActivityMonitors can be automatically configured (GrandOutput uses this).
		- Effective use of ActivityMonitor.Filter that improves performance (Trace, Info, etc. formatting and sending is not executed at all if not required).

- Disparition:
	- No more Predicate<T> anywhere. ONLY Func<T,bool> exists and must be used.
	- ActivityLogger is replaced with ActivityMonitor.
	- No more Empty objetcs (ie. Null object pattern) on ActivityLogger/Monitor.
	- No more IDefaultActivityLogger, Tap and Sinks.
	- No more DefaultActivityLogger/Monitor.
	- LegacySupport/CallerMemberNameAttribute in favor of BCL Portability Pack.
	- InvalidFileException.
