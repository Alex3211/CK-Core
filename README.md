##Content##

Contains several helper classes and interfaces.

CKTrait handle the combination of different tags (strings) in a determinist manner. 
Traits are normalized and ordered strings combinations (*"Sql|DB access|Subscription" == "DB access|Sql|Subscription"* and *"DB access|Sql" > "Sql"*): a total order exists on the set of traits combinations based on lexicographical order for atomic trait and the number of traits in a composite. They support union, intersect, except and symmetric except in O(n).

###CK.ActivityMonitor###
Contains the ActivityMonitor base implementation.
